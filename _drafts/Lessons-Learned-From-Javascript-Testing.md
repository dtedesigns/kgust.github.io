Introducing the "Lessons Learned From Javascript Testing" series.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Today I'm beginning a new series of articles from the work that I'm doing with Javascript testing.  Writing Javascript is not my full-time job but recently I've been thrown into it.  I've learned a bunch of lessons about BDD, Testing, and Javascript in general.  Buckle in, it might get a little bumpy.

**Table of Contents**

* [Introduction][1]: Choosing the Technologies
* [Testem][2]: The Test Runner
* [Mocha][3]: A Testing Framework
* [Chai][4]: Asserts and Expectations
* [Sinon.js][5]: Javascript Spies, Stubs, and Mocks
* [jQuery Deferreds][6]: Exception Problems
* [Exceptions Part 2][7]: Q to the rescue?
