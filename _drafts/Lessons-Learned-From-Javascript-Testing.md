Introducing the "Lessons Learned From Javascript Testing" series.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Today I'm beginning a new series of articles from the work that I'm doing with Javascript testing.  Writing Javascript is not my full-time job but recently I've been thrown into it.  I've learned a bunch of lessons about BDD, Testing, and Javascript in general.  Buckle in, it might get a little bumpy.

** Table of Contents **

* Introduction: Choosing the Technologies
* Testem: The Test Runner
* Mocha: A Testing Framework
* Chai: Asserts and Expectations
* Sinon.js: Javascript Spies, Stubs, and Mocks
* jQuery Deferreds: Exception Problems
* Exceptions Part 2: Q to the rescue?
