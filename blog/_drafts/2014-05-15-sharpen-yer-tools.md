# Sharpen Yer Tools!

On May 14, 2014, I gave presentation for the [Fox Valley Computing
Professionals](http://www.meetup.com/foxvalleycp/) about keeping
your development tools sharp. I thought it would be good to share
that information here too.

## The Basics of Tool Sharpening

    Keep your knife sharp. There are few things more dangerous than a dull knife.
    â€” Mervin Gustavson (my dad)

## What does tool sharpening have to do with computers?

* A well maintained tool is a pleasure to use; a friend.
* A neglected tool will often let you down when you need it most.

## The Basics

### Habits are powerful!

### Make a short list of things that annoy you.

#### My List:

* Shell: git tab completion doesn't work for all subcommands
* Shell: codeception isn't tab completing
* Vim: I want Javascript files to open _unfolded_.
* Vim: Enable PHP Syntax checking [PSR-2]
* Vim: Copy-Yank-Put directly with the system clipboard (clipboard=unnamed)
* etc....

#### Making a list

* When you encounter something that annoys you, write it on your list.
* Whenever you say, there must be a better way to do this, add it to your list.
* When you need something but don't have time research right now... (you know what to do).
* When you find yourself making the same typo over and over... (well?)

#### Spend 10-15 minutes every day on your list

* Prioritize your list by agony.
* Try to complete a least one item on your list every day.

### Time to develop a new habit (Let's make a second list.)

This is a list of things that you're learning.

* Keep this list near your desk
* Bad habits you want to break
* New habits you are trying to form
* Shortcuts you want to remember to use
* If necessary, go back and repeat using the new method.
* Cross off items as you complete them.

### Then you'll be...

* Slowly sanding down those rough edges.
* Doing your job better and faster.
* Having greater job satisfaction.
