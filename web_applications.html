        <p class='description'>
            Using SlickSend, a client is able to create flex
            forms for his website so their users can use that form to upload files
            and provide related information. I&apos;m not able to provide access to
            a demo site, so I&apos;ve provided screenshots of the web application
            in action.<br />
            This program was meant to be a companion program to Reproconnect 5 and
            thus shares much of the styling from that program.
        </p>

        <p class='description'>
            <strong>My role:</strong> I was the main programmer for the backend. The
            Flex form was created by another programmer and I created a PHP backend
            using KohanaPHP and Doctrine.

            This is the frontend for a custom web application for

            <strong>My role:</strong> I was the main programmer. The styling was
            adapted from an earlier version of this web application, however this is
            a complete rewrite. The structure of the system was largely provided by
            system designer, but the implementation (including database) was up to me.

            <strong>My role:</strong>I was the main programmer on this project.
            This was a complete rewrite of a desktop-style application. The
            functionality and some of the style was suggested by the web designer.
            Nearly all of the coding was done by me.
