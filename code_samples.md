Code should be clear, consise, and written so that it is self-documenting
as much as possible. I take pride in all the code that I produce.

## Online Samples

I'm the maintainer of the [MessiJS](http://github.com/MessiJS/MessiJS)
Project. That is a good example of my JavaScript skills.

## Other Samples

This first snippet of code contains JavaScript and jQuery functions
that control the dynamic scoring of my 2009 Post-Christmas Quiz.
When activated, it scores the quiz and highlights both the correct
answers and the incorrect answers.

This second code sample is a Kohana controller action from an
internal web application. This is code reuse at it's best. One
single controller action to save four (easily expanded to more)
different types of form submissions; each to it's own appropriate
database table. The action uses Doctrine as the database access
layer (DBAL) and object relational mapping (ORM).

This particular view is from a Kohana web application. This is the
corresponding view for the controller. This is a example of how to
mix HTML markup with PHP variables.
