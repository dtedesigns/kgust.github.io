Greetings... and Purpose
========================

Why Another Blog?  (Why I do what I do!)
----------------------------------------

A blog is simply a forum were a person can express themself.  This
one is no different.

I will be primarily writing about two topics, technology and my
faith in the Living God.  I'll categorize my posts so you want to
follow one of those topics but not the other, that will be possible.

### Technology

I will be writing on what I'm learning through work and some of the
things I'm researching on my own.

Currently they include:

* PHP (Symfony2, Composer, etc.)
* Javascript (jQuery and OOP practices)
* Testing (BDD/TDD, PHPUnit, Mocha, etc.)
* Android (and other mobile topics)
* Any new stuff...

### The Living God

If you knew for certain that there was a living, loving, holy God
who could see everything that you see and hear, how would that
change how you live?  I believe this is the reality that we will
in and will explore the ramifications of this truth.
