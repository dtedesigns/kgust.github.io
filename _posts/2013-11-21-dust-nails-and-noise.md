Dust, Nails, and Noise!
=======================

I'm currently editing the website.  This includes:

* The website is now Jekyll powered.
* Updating some of the descriptions.
* A new Blog section.
* The contact form is currently using Google Forms.

I've converted this site from a simple live php site to a [Jekyll][jekyll]-powered site.  The resulting website is static and doesn't support normal contact forms.  Currently, I'm using a [Google Form][google-form] as a temporary solution.

The blog will be read-only—no comments—at least for now.  Those that have a Github account can open an issue for comments or typos[¹][github].
